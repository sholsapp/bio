The `bio` is a module that provides global and local alignment algorithms
for aligning character sequences and strings using algorithms usually used in
genetic sequencing.

It can be used for more than just aligning strings of DNA, though. If you are
able to represent any sequence of events as a sequence of symbols, you can use
this module to align them with some arbitrary cost matrix.
